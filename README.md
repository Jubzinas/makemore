# Makemore Neural Network

Makemore is a simple neural network designed to generate new words based on a given training dataset of words. This model can be particularly useful for creative applications, such as generating names, fictional languages, or other text-based data where new word creation is desired.

## Features

- Train a neural network on a dataset of words.
- Generate new words based on the patterns learned from the training dataset.
- Simple implementation using PyTorch.

## Installation
